Working with APIs in JavaScript: Making Web API Requests and Processing Responses
Introduction
The role of APIs in web development.
Why working with APIs is essential in JavaScript development.
Overview of the topics covered.
Understanding APIs
What are APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)?
Types of APIs: Web APIs, REST APIs, SOAP APIs, etc.
Real-world use cases for APIs.
Making API Requests
Using JavaScript libraries like Axios and Fetch to make HTTP requests.
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP methods.
Handling request headers and parameters.
Processing API Responses
Handling asynchronous operations with Promises and async/await.
Parsing JSON data from API responses.
Error handling and status codes.
API Authentication
Types of API authentication: API keys, OAuth, and token-based authentication.
Implementing authentication in JavaScript applications.
Security considerations.
Rate Limiting and Throttling
Understanding rate limits imposed by APIs.
Implementing rate limiting and throttling mechanisms in JavaScript.
Strategies to handle rate limit exceeded scenarios.
Pagination and Data Fetching
Techniques for handling paginated API responses.
Fetching and displaying large datasets efficiently.
